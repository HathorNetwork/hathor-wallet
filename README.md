# Hathor Wallet

Welcome to Hathor Light Wallet. To view the source code of the project access [Github](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet). You can follow the progress of our next tasks in our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/kNWB1v5e/hathor-wallet).

## Architecture

The wallet is developed using Javascript with [React](https://reactjs.org/). We use [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) to generate native desktop apps from it.

## Download

You can download the newest version of the wallet for each specific platform.

- Download for [macOS](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet/releases/download/v0.7.0-beta/Hathor.Wallet-0.7.0-beta.dmg)
- Download for [Windows](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet/releases/download/v0.7.0-beta/Hathor.Wallet.Setup.0.7.0-beta.exe)
- Download for [Linux (deb)](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet/releases/download/v0.7.0-beta/hathor-wallet_0.7.0-beta_amd64.deb)
- Download for [Linux (AppImage)](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet/releases/download/v0.7.0-beta/Hathor.Wallet.0.7.0-beta.AppImage)

### Warning Message for Windows:

We are finishing the process of acquiring the certificates for Windows. While we don't get it you may see a warning message when opening the wallet.

![Warning Windows](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1B5kLAXUMj4wmrRfmVtiQyoNe6Q7r8s_h&sz=w500-h375)

This screen will show a warning, so you need to click on 'More info'. Another screen will appear, then just click the button 'Run anyway' to start the wallet.

## Screenshots

The basic view of the wallet.  Note that different types of tokens are made possible in the Hathor Network.  On the left hand side we see both a HTR tab and a MTK tab, for the Hathor token, and a different, ERC-20 like, token.

## For development

### To Install

`npm install`

### To Run

`npm start` and it will start running in the browser in http://localhost:3000

### To Build

`npm run buil` and it will create a folder build with the files to use

## Server

By default the wallet will connect to the server selected as the `DEFAULT_SERVER` in the constants file (`src/constants.js`).
You can change this anytime in the 'Change Server' screen inside the wallet.

## Documentation

To generate a html page with the documentation from the code comments run:

`jsdoc -c jsdoc.json -r src/. README.md`

and it will generate a `index.html` file in `out/index.html`

## Run Electron

`npm run build`
`npm run electron`

## Build package for Electron

`npm run electron-pack`

If you have an error building `Error: Python executable "/path/to/python" is v3.6.5, which is not supported by gyp.`

Just run `npm config set python /usr/bin/python` and try again

## Sentry

Sentry is a error tracking tool, that allow us to receive error data from clients - it will be disabled on stable versions of the wallet.

### DSN
On `public/constants.js` we have a default Sentry DSN.
To override it simply set the environment variable `SENTRY_DSN`.

### Source maps
To allow stack traces to be mapped to source code, Sentry needs the source maps.
To upload the source maps, create a `.sentryclirc` with the format:

```
[defaults]
url=https://sentry.io/
org=<ORGANIZATION_NAME>
project=<PROJECT_NAME>

[auth]
token=<CLI_API_TOKEN>
```

You can find more information about the configuration file and its fields [here](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/configuration/).
After configuring it, just run the `upload_source_maps.sh` script to upload the source maps.

**WARNING**: Please note that this will override all the source maps for the current sentry release.

The sentry release used is the `version` field in the `package.json` file.
So in order to not break any released source maps, only run the script after bumping `package.json` to a new version.
For test purposes use `*-beta` versions or identifiers that will not colide with semantic versioning.

## TODO

- The algorithm to automatically choose the unspent transactions when sending tokens is naive. For now we do not consider any anonymity factor.
- The addresses shared with the user and the ones used in change outputs are generated by the same chain in the HD Wallet. We don't separate internal and external addresses.
